# Awesome-RAG
This is a repo to show the recent RAG approaches. There are several research line to RAGs. One is to finetuning the LLM to enhance the ability of LLM to use the external knowledge. For example, self-rag use some **reflection token** to teach LLM whether use the external knowledge or not.  DRAGIN is a dynamic RAG method to address the complex multi-step tasks. They develop an Real-time Information Needs Detection and Query Formulation based on Selfattention (QFS) methods. In the paper "Making Retrieval-Augmented Language Models Robust to Irrelevant Context", the author find that RALM are are now robust for the irrelevant documents, to address this, they train some examples to make models robust to irrelevant context and improve overall performance.


## Text-based RAG 

### Robust RAG

It have been proved that the LLM can be easily distracted by irrelevant context. To alleviate this, there are several methods to make the RAG more robust.
